# Parking Lot

Deferred product/engineering items that are important, but not in current MVP scope.

## Booking Fulfillment Model (Owner-Mediated)

Status: Deferred by design for MVP.

Current decision:
- Booking remains owner-mediated.
- Traveler requests and pays in Timeshare Connect.
- Owner logs into resort/timeshare portal and completes booking or guest certificate flow.
- Owner uploads proof in app for verification.

Why this is parked:
- Direct resort integrations are not broadly available and vary by brand.
- Owner-mediated flow is the fastest realistic path for MVP launch.

Future options to revisit:
1. Concierge mode:
   Platform operations team performs owner-side booking steps for participating owners.
2. Semi-automation:
   Portal-specific helper workflows, saved step templates, auto-generated checklists.
3. Deep integrations:
   Resort/brand APIs, partner access, or enterprise booking connectors where available.
